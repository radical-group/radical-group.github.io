## Abstract:

Many scientific problems require multiple distinct computational tasks to be 
executed in order to achieve a desired solution. We introduce the Ensemble 
Toolkit (EnTK) to address the challenges of scale, diversity and reliability 
they pose. We describe the design and implementation of EnTK, characterize its 
performance and integrate it with two distinct exemplar use cases: seismic 
inversion and adaptive analog ensembles. We perform nine experiments, 
characterizing EnTK overheads, strong and weak scalability, and the performance
of two use case implementations, at scale and on production infrastructures. We 
show how EnTK meets the following general requirements: (i) implementing 
dedicated abstractions to support the description and execution of ensemble 
applications; (ii) support for execution on heterogeneous computing 
infrastructures; (iii) efficient scalability up to O(10^4) tasks; and (iv) fault
tolerance. We discuss novel computational capabilities that EnTK enables and the
scientific advantages arising thereof. We propose EnTK as an important addition
to the suite of tools in support of production scientific computing.
